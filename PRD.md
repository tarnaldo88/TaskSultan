## User Stories (MVP)

1. As a user, I can sign up and create a workspace.
2. As a workspace admin, I can invite members to my workspace.
3. As a member, I can create projects within my workspace.
4. As a project member, I can create, assign, and update tasks.
5. As a user, I can view tasks in a Kanban board and move them between states.
6. As a user, I receive notifications when tasks are assigned to me or commented on.
7. As a user, I can search and filter tasks by various criteria.

---

## MVP Roadmap

1. User authentication & workspace setup
2. Project and task CRUD
3. Kanban board UI
4. Task assignment & state management
5. Comments & notifications
6. Basic search & filters
7. Deployment & onboarding

---

## Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)

- Custom workflows and automations
- Gantt chart view
- Reporting and analytics dashboard
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Plugin/extension marketplace

---

## Success Metrics

- User signups and active users
- Number of tasks created and completed
- Team retention and engagement rates
- User satisfaction (NPS, feedback)
- Performance and uptime

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Complexity Creep:** Focus MVP on core task management, defer advanced features.
- **Security:** Use best practices for authentication, data storage, and auditing.
- **Scalability:** Design for scale from the start (cloud-native, stateless services).
